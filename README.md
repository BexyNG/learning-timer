## 💻 How to Use the Web App

1. **Set your times** – Adjust the input fields for *Focus* and *Break* durations.  
2. **Start focusing** – Hit the `Start` button to launch the timer.  
3. **Take a break** – When the focus period ends, an alarm sounds; relax until the break timer finishes.  
4. **Repeat** – The app automatically cycles between focus and break sessions, keeping you in the flow.
